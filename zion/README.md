Additional packaages added for the Zion project, nothing in here should be in the Matrix Dendrite upstream, nor in the herenotthere/dendrite-fork.

The zion_space_manager_(mainnet|rinkeby|localhost).go files are generated as new versions of the smart contracts are build and deployed. The bindings are in this location so they can be built alongside the dendrite server in the build process.
