# Harmony

Welcome to the Harmony mono repo. Here you will find all of the components to run the complete Harmony service, including clients, services, protocols and contracts. As new components directories are added please update this readme to give a summary overview, and indicate if the component origin is Harmony, or if a component is a fork of a component that should be tracked.
