# Contributing to Towns Protocol

## Prerequisites

- **Go**: [https://go.dev/](https://go.dev/)
- **Node v20.x.x**: We recommend using a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install node.
- **Docker**: We're using Docker to run PostgreSQL and Redis for local node development.
- **Yarn 2.x**: We're using yarn v2, to handle our monorepo. There should be only one `node_modules` and one lockfile at the root of the repository.
- **Anvil**: We're using Anvil to run a local Base network for development. Please follow the instructions [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) to install Anvil.
- **Just**: We're using Just to run commands in the CLI. Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/casey/just) to install Just.
- **jq**: Json parser utility for the CLI.

## Setup

1. Run `yarn install && yarn prepare` from the root of the repository

1. Create `.env.local` files:

1. Create a Certificate Authority. Run `./core/scripts/register-ca.sh` from the root of the repository. This will create the required `$HOME/river-ca-cert.pem` and `$HOME/river-ca-key.pem` files.

## Running everything locally

Open VScode in the root of this directory: `code .`

Launch local server via .vscode/tasks.json:

- Use the keystroke: `CMD+P` to bring up the switcher and type `task ~Start Local Dev~` (Once you type the word "task" you will see all the options from task.json in the dropdown)

This workflow runs the `.vscode/tasks.json` task labeled `~Start Local Dev~` and starts everything needed to work and run integration tests locally.

If you want to restart everything, `CMD+P` + `task KillAllLocalDev` will search for and terminate our processes. Please note this script both needs to be kept up to date if something is added, and also has very broad search parameters. If you want to try it out first, running `./scripts/kill-all-local-dev.sh` from the terminal will prompt you before it kills anything.

If you want to restart just the server, `CMD+P` + `task RestartCasablanca` will relaunch the servers. Same for `CMD+P` + `task RestartWatches`

## Tests

- Run all unit tests via: `yarn test:unit`
- Run all e2e tests via: `yarn test:e2e`
- Run all tests (both unit and e2e) via: `yarn test`

CI will gate PR merges via unit tests. However, failing e2e tests won't gate merges. In fact, they won't even be run pre-merge. e2e tests will be run after merging to main. This allows us to keep merging our work to main, while also staying aware of failing e2e tests.

## Package.json Scripts

We use turborepo to maintain our monorepos CI setup. Since maintaining CI in monorepos are a bit more complex than conventional repos, we depend on this tool for housekeeping. It figures out the dependency graph by reading package.jsons and understands which builds and tests should be run first.

If you have a package in the monorepo, and
a) you want it to be built on CI, add a `"build"` script
b) you want it to be linted on CI, add a `"lint"` script
c) you want its unit tests to be run on CI, add a `"test:unit"` script

Sincerely,
The team
d) you want its e2e tests to be run on CI, add a `"test:e2e"` script
e) you want a single script to run all tests within the package, add `"test: yarn test:unit && yarn test:e2e"` script to its package.json

Similarly, if you edit or delete these scripts, be aware that you may be removing those scripts from CI.

## Publishing to npm

If you have the permission to publish to npm, you can run the following script to publish the packages to npm.

```
./scripts/publish-to-npm.sh
```
