# When triggered, will deploy the Towns app to the specified environment.
# Note: This script does not affect what code gets deployed. Every app
# on render.com has an associated branch. For example, the test and
# production apps both point to the "main" branch. This means that any
# deploy to those environments will just take the latest commit on the
# "main" branch.
