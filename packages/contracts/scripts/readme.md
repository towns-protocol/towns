## Opinionated deployment scripting ðŸš€

Inspired by [hardhat-deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy)

This project supports two methods for deploying contracts:

### Method 1: Custom Deployment Scripts

For each contract being deployed, we create a script that will:

1. inherit from `Deployer`
2. implement a `versionName()` and `__deploy()` function

Example contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import { Deployer } from "contracts/scripts/common/Deployer.s.sol";
import { MockERC721A } from "contracts/test/mocks/MockERC721A.sol";

contract DeployMockERC721A is Deployer {
  function versionName() public pure override returns (string memory) {
    return "mockERC721A";
  }

  function __deploy(address deployer) public override returns (address) {
    vm.broadcast(deployer);
    return address(new MockERC721A());
  }
}
```

The framework will:

1. Load an existing deployment from `contracts/deployments/<context>/<chainIdAlias>/<contracts>.json`

2. if `OVERRIDE_DEPLOYMENTS=1` is set or if no deployments are found, it will:

- read `PRIVATE_KEY` from env (LOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY for anvil) or wait for ledger
- invoke `__deploy()` function
- if `SAVE_DEPLOYMENTS` is set; it will save the deployment to `contracts/deployments/<context>/<chainIdAlias>/<contract>.json`

### Method 2: DeployFacet Script (For Facet Contracts)

For facet contract deployments, we also support a standardized deployment process using the `DeployFacet.s.sol` script which:

1. Uses deterministic CREATE2 addresses for predictable deployment outcomes
2. Supports batch deployments for gas efficiency
3. Provides advanced gas estimation and deployment verification

To deploy a facet with this method, you set the `CONTRACT_NAME` environment variable and call the script:

```
CONTRACT_NAME=MyFacet forge script scripts/common/DeployFacet.s.sol
```

Or use the convenience makefile commands:

```
make deploy-facet rpc=base_sepolia contract=MyFacet
```

For more details on the DeployFacet functionality, see the [DeployFacet documentation](../node_modules/@towns-protocol/diamond/scripts/README.md).

## Comparing the Two Methods

| Feature             | Custom Deployment Scripts           | DeployFacet                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Deployment Method   | Standard deployment                 | CREATE2 deterministic addresses     |
| Contract Support    | Any contract type                   | Optimized for facet contracts       |
| Implementation      | Requires custom script per contract | Standardized for all facets         |
| Address Consistency | Different per deployment            | Same across networks with same salt |
| Batch Deployments   | No native support                   | Built-in support                    |

## Flags

- `OVERRIDE_DEPLOYMENTS=1`: It will redeploy a version of the contracts even if there's a cache in deployments assigned, be very careful when using this
- `SAVE_DEPLOYMENTS=1`: It will save a cached address of deployments to `contracts/deployments/<network>/<contract>.json`
- `DEPLOYMENT_CONTEXT=string`: It will save the addresses on a subdirectory with the given name, useful for deployment contract to same network

## How to deploy locally (step-by-step)

```bash
# say you want to deploy a new MockERC721A

# Provision a new deployer
-> cast wallet new

# save the key in .env (LOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY=...)

# Fund the deployer address (this is the first address shown when runing `anvil`)
-> cast send ${NEW_WALLET_ADDRESS} --value 1ether -f 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 --unlocked

# perform a local simulation
-> forge script script/${CONTRACT}.s.sol

# perform a simulation against a network
-> forge script script/${CONTRACT}.s.sol --rpc-url <network>

# run anvil in separate terminal
-> anvil

# perform the deployment to a local network
# Option 1: Custom deployment script
-> make deploy-any-local contract=DeployMockERC721A type=facets

# Option 2: Using the DeployFacet script (for facet contracts)
-> make deploy-facet-local rpc=base_anvil contract=MockERC721A
```

## How to deploy to a testnet or mainnet

```bash
# Method 1: Using custom deployment scripts
# To deploy a contract to Base Sepolia in the "gamma" deployment context:
-> make deploy-base-sepolia contract=DeployWalletLink type=facets context=gamma

# Method 2: Using the DeployFacet script
# To deploy a facet to Base Sepolia:
-> make deploy-facet rpc=base_sepolia contract=WalletLink context=gamma

# To deploy with a ledger hardware wallet to Base mainnet:
# Method 1: Using custom deployment scripts
-> make deploy-base contract=DeploySpaceFactory type=diamonds context=omega

# Method 2: Using the DeployFacet script
-> make deploy-facet-ledger rpc=base contract=WalletLink context=omega

# To redeploy a contract to Base Sepolia in the "gamma" deployment context:
-> OVERRIDE_DEPLOYMENTS=1 make deploy-base-sepolia contract=DeployWalletLink type=facets context=gamma
```

## How to script (interact with deployed contracts through foundry)

```bash
# say you want to mint from MockERC721A

# deploy a local implementation of MockERC721A by calling DeployFacet
-> make deploy-facet-local rpc=base_anvil contract=MockERC721A

# next we'll call the script InteractMockERC721A
# This will grab new and existing deployment addresses from our deployments cache and use those to interact with each other
-> make interact-any-local rpc=base_anvil contract=InteractMockERC721A
```
