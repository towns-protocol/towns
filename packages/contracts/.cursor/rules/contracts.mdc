# Contracts Rule

These rules are essential for working with a complex blockchain-based space management and permission system. They're particularly helpful when:

1. Implementing new features or modifying existing ones in the space management system
2. Working with cross-chain entitlements and permission validation
3. Developing token distribution mechanisms or reward systems
4. Adding or modifying role-based access control
5. Upgrading contracts using the Diamond Pattern
6. Implementing new entitlement types or rules
7. Debugging permission or access control issues
8. Writing tests for contract interactions

## Overview

This project is a blockchain-based space/channel management system with role-based access control and entitlements. It implements a complex permission system using smart contracts that allows for cross-chain rule validation and user management.

The system also supports cross-chain delegation between Ethereum L1 and Base L2, allowing users to stake tokens on L1 and have delegation benefits on L2. Node operators can receive delegations directly or via spaces, with rewards distributed based on stake amounts and time.

### The system allows for:

- Creation and management of spaces and channels
- Role-based access control with granular permissions
- Cross-chain entitlement validation
- User membership management
- Rule-based entitlements with logical operations
- Staking and rewards distribution for DAO participants and node operators
- Cross-chain delegation and governance mechanisms

## Tech Stack

- Solidity ^0.8.23
- OpenZeppelin Contracts
- Solady Contracts
- Diamond Pattern (EIP-2535) for upgradeable contracts
- Foundry for development and testing
- TypeScript for contract type generation

### Diamond Facet Storage

Every new facet/feature must use the following storage pattern to avoid collision:

```solidity
library FacetStorage {
  // A hash calculate by running
  // keccak256(abi.encode(uint256(keccak256("folder.path.to.feature")) - 1)) & ~bytes32(uint256(0xff))
  bytes32 internal constant STORAGE_SLOT =
    0x672ef851d5f92307da037116e23aa9e31af7e1f7e3ca62c4e6d540631df3fd00;

  struct Layout {
    // storage variables go here
  }

  function layout() internal pure returns (Layout storage db) {
    assembly {
      db.slot := STORAGE_SLOT
    }
  }
}
```

### Facet Example: Structure and Storage

A typical facet in this codebase is split into several files for clarity and upgrade safety:

- **Storage Library**: Handles diamond storage slot and layout.
- **Base Contract**: Implements internal logic and interacts with storage.
- **Facet Contract**: Exposes external/protected functions and inherits the base.
- **Interfaces**: Define external APIs.

**Note**: A Library with a Mod suffix can act as both storage handler and internal business logic

**Example: Votes Facet**

- [`VotesStorage.sol`](mdc:src/diamond/facets/governance/votes/VotesStorage.sol)

  ```solidity
  library VotesStorage {
    bytes32 internal constant STORAGE_SLOT =
      keccak256("diamond.facets.governance.votes.storage");

    struct Layout {
      mapping(address => address) _delegation;
      mapping(address => Checkpoints.Trace224) _delegateCheckpoints;
      Checkpoints.Trace224 _totalCheckpoints;
    }

    function layout() internal pure returns (Layout storage db) {
      assembly {
        db.slot := STORAGE_SLOT
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- [`VotesBase.sol`](mdc:src/diamond/facets/governance/votes/VotesBase.sol)

  ```solidity
  abstract contract VotesBase is IVotesBase {
    using VotesStorage for VotesStorage.Layout;
    function _getVotes(address account) internal view returns (uint256) {
      return VotesStorage.layout()._delegateCheckpoints[account].latest();
    }
    // ... more internal logic ...
  }
  ```

- [`Votes.sol`](mdc:src/diamond/facets/governance/votes/Votes.sol)

  ```solidity
  contract Votes is IVotes, VotesBase, Facet {
    function getVotes(address account) public view virtual returns (uint256) {
      return _getVotes(account);
    }
    // ... external functions ...
  }
  ```

- **Guidelines**
  - Use the diamond storage pattern to avoid collisions
  - Split facet implementation into Storage Library, Base Contract, Facet Contract, and Interfaces
  - Or split facet into Module Library, Facet Contract and Interfaces
  - Place business logic in a base contract.
  - Expose only protected/external calls in the facet contract.
  - Define interfaces for external APIs.

### Deployment Script Example: Using Libraries

Deployment scripts use helper libraries to deploy facets and assemble the diamond. Each facet has a deployment library that provides selectors and cut data.

**Example: Deploying a Diamond with Facets**

- [`DeployMembership.s.sol`](mdc:scripts/deployments/facets/DeployMembership.s.sol)

  ```solidity
  library DeployMembership {
      function selectors() internal pure returns (bytes4[] memory) { ... }

      function makeCut(address facetAddress, IDiamond.FacetCutAction action)
          internal pure returns (IDiamond.FacetCut memory)
      { ... }

      function deploy() internal returns (address) {
          return DeployLib.deployCode("MembershipFacet.sol", "");
      }
  }
  ```

- [`DeploySpace.s.sol`](mdc:scripts/deployments/diamonds/DeploySpace.s.sol)
  ```solidity
  contract DeploySpace is IDiamondInitHelper, DiamondHelper, Deployer {
      function addImmutableCuts(address deployer) internal {
          address facet = facetHelper.deploy("DiamondCutFacet", deployer);
          addFacet(
              DeployDiamondCut.makeCut(facet, IDiamond.FacetCutAction.Add),
              facet,
              DeployDiamondCut.makeInitData()
          );
          // ... more facets ...
      }
      function diamondInitParams(address deployer) public returns (Diamond.InitParams memory) {
          address facet = facetHelper.deploy("MembershipToken", deployer);
          addCut(DeployMembership.makeCut(facet, IDiamond.FacetCutAction.Add));
          // ... more facets ...
          return Diamond.InitParams({ ... });
      }
      function __deploy(address deployer) internal override returns (address) {
          addImmutableCuts(deployer);
          Diamond.InitParams memory initDiamondCut = diamondInitParams(deployer);
          Diamond diamond = new Diamond(initDiamondCut);
          return address(diamond);
      }
  }
  ```

**Key Patterns:**

- Each facet has a deployment library that provides selectors and cut data.
- The deployment script uses these libraries to deploy facets, build the diamond cut, and initialize the diamond.
- Facet deployment is modular and can be customized by passing different facet lists.
