# @towns-protocol/anvil-docker

This package contains Docker configuration for running local blockchain networks with pre-deployed smart contracts for Towns Protocol development.

## Quick Start

From this package directory:

```bash
yarn docker:start    # Start both chain containers (Base + River)
yarn docker:logs     # View logs from both containers
yarn docker:stop     # Stop and remove both containers
```

Or use the traditional justfile commands:

```bash
cd ../../core
USE_DOCKER_CHAINS=1 just anvils
```

## Overview

The Docker environment provides:

- **Base Chain** (port 8545) and **River Chain** (port 8546) with Anvil
- **Pre-deployed smart contracts** in both chains during image build
- **Fast startup** by loading pre-deployed blockchain state
- **Contract address extraction** for local development integration

All just targets support both Docker and native modes - Docker is used when `USE_DOCKER_CHAINS=1`, native Anvil otherwise.

**Hash-based Versioning**: Docker images are automatically tagged with the git hash of Docker-related files (anvil-docker package, contract source, deployment scripts). The system pulls from AWS ECR if available, or builds locally if the specific version doesn't exist remotely.

## Getting Started

### Using Pre-built Image (Recommended)

```bash
cd core
USE_DOCKER_CHAINS=1 just anvils        # Start chains with pre-deployed contracts (1s blocks)
RIVER_BLOCK_TIME=2 USE_DOCKER_CHAINS=1 just anvils  # Start with 2-second blocks
USE_DOCKER_CHAINS=1 just config        # Configure nodes
just anvils-stop                       # Stop chains
```

### Building Image Locally

```bash
cd core
just build-anvil-docker
USE_DOCKER_CHAINS=1 just anvils
```

### VSCode Integration

VSCode tasks automatically use Docker chains by default:

- **~Start Local Dev~** - Uses Docker chains with hash-based versioning
- **~Start Local Dev (Native Anvil)~** - Fallback option using native Anvil
- **Start Anvil Chains** - Starts both chains using Docker
- **Start Anvil Chains (Native)** - Starts both chains using native Anvil

## Files

### `Dockerfile`

Multi-stage build: installs dependencies, builds contracts, deploys via `setup.sh`, creates optimized runtime image.

### `scripts/setup.sh`

Build-time script: starts chains, deploys contracts, saves state files, copies addresses to `/app/local_dev/`.

### `scripts/run.sh`

Runtime script: starts chains with pre-loaded state. Supports `CHAIN=base` or `CHAIN=river`.

## Contract Address Extraction

When using Docker chains, contract addresses are automatically extracted during the deployment process:

```bash
# Addresses are automatically extracted when using Docker chains
USE_DOCKER_CHAINS=1 just config
```

which runs `just-deploy-contracts`. Contract addresses are extracted to `packages/generated/deployments/local_dev/`.

## Package Scripts

This package provides convenient npm scripts for Docker operations:

```bash
yarn docker:build      # Build Docker image locally (via just)
yarn docker:start      # Start both chain containers (via just)
yarn docker:stop       # Stop and remove both containers (via just)
yarn docker:restart    # Restart both containers
yarn docker:logs       # View logs from both containers
yarn docker:logs:base  # View Base chain container logs
yarn docker:logs:river # View River chain container logs
yarn docker:shell      # Start fresh container for inspection
yarn anvil:status      # Check if anvil processes are running in containers
yarn chain:base        # Get Base chain block number
yarn chain:river       # Get River chain block number
```

## Available Just Targets

### Unified targets (Docker or native):

- `anvils` - Start both chains
- `anvil-base` - Start Base chain
- `anvil-river` - Start River chain
- `anvils-stop` - Stop both chains
- `deploy-contracts` - Deploy contracts and create configs
- `just-deploy-contracts` - Deploy contracts only (used internally)

### Docker-specific targets:

- `build-anvil-docker` - Build Anvil Docker image locally

## Environment Variables

- `USE_DOCKER_CHAINS` - Set to `1` to use Docker chains instead of native Anvil
- `RIVER_BLOCK_TIME` - Block time in seconds for Anvil chains (defaults to `1`)
- `RUN_ENV` - Environment (defaults to `local_dev`)

## Network Configuration

- **Base Chain**: Port 8545, Chain ID 31337, RPC: `http://localhost:8545`
- **River Chain**: Port 8546, Chain ID 31338, RPC: `http://localhost:8546`

Both chains include pre-deployed contracts:

- Space Factory, Base Registry, App Registry
- River Registry, Multicall3, Permit2
- Test contracts and utilities
