## **Deployment and Initial Supply**

$TOWNS is deployed as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum Mainnet with an initial supply of 10 billion tokens.

## **Inflation Process**

- **Annual Inflation**: The TOWNS supply increases once per year through a publicly callable function, providing predictable token inflation.
- **Minting**: The inflation process mints new tokens equal to that year's designated inflation amount.

## **Distribution on Base**

- **Bridging to Base**: TOWNS tokens are distributed on the Base blockchain through either a bridge protocol or a multisig wallet, with the distribution contract on Base as the final destination.
- **Distribution Contract**: This contract on Base handles reward allocation each claim cycle, factoring in active Node Operators, percentage fees, and delegated token distribution.

## **Reward Allocation and Claiming**

- **Claim Cycles**: At the end of each epoch, tokens become claimable through the distribution contract, synchronizing rewards with network operations.
- **Signaling and Reward Adjustment**: The protocol uses a signaling system to monitor node behavior. The DAO and other nodes can report misconduct, which affects reward allocation to ensure fair distribution and incentivize proper operation.
