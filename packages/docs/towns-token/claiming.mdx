## Claim Process

At the end of each distribution period, addresses that are delegating or designated as [Authorized Claimers](./delegation) can claim their rewards.

## Claim Execution

Rewards are claimed by calling the `claimReward(address beneficiary, address recipient)` function on the [RewardsDistribution](https://github.com/towns-protocol/towns/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/base/registry/facets/distribution/v2/RewardsDistribution.sol) contract, which transfers the tokens to the recipient's wallet.

The `claimReward` function is called from the claimer address, who is either the beneficiary or an authorized claimer that can claim the reward for the beneficiary.

<Note>
  Since the RewardsDistribution contract is a facet of the BaseRegistry contract, the `claimReward` function is called from the BaseRegistry contract address (see [contracts](../run/contracts)).
</Note>

To view the current reward claimable by `claimReward` in wei, call `currentReward(address beneficiary)` on the RewardsDistribution contract from the BaseRegistry diamond contract.

The following example shows how to call `currentReward` from the BaseRegistry diamond contract with `cast`:

```
cast call \
--rpc-url $BASE_RPC_URL \
"0x7c0422b31401C936172C897802CF0373B35B7698" \
"currentReward(address)(uint256)" \
"0xa4742402D6E314a069CeB1c3C2C4eFb2982d7D44"

37995641418907243501899 [3.799e22]
```

<Note>
  To convert the current reward to base token units from wei, divide the result by `1e18`.
