title: "Claiming Rewards"

## Claim Process

At the end of each distribution period, addresses that are delegating or designated as [Authorized Claimers](./delegation) can claim their rewards.

## Claim Execution

To claim rewards, call the **claimReward(address beneficiary, address recipient)** function on the [**RewardsDistribution**](https://github.com/towns-protocol/towns/blob/main/contracts/src/base/registry/facets/distribution/v2/RewardsDistribution.sol) contract. This transfers tokens to the recipient's wallet.

The claim must be initiated from a claimer addressâ€”either the beneficiary themselves or their authorized claimer.

<Note>
  Since the RewardsDistribution contract is a facet of the BaseRegistry contract, the `claimReward` function is called from the BaseRegistry contract address (see [contracts](../run/contracts)).
</Note>

For wallets already delegating on Base, claimed tokens automatically delegate to the same operator, following the [**ERC20Votes**](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#ERC20Votes) specification.

To view the current reward claimable by `claimReward` in wei, call `currentReward(address beneficiary)` on the RewardsDistribution contract from the BaseRegistry diamond contract.

The following example shows how to call `currentReward` from the BaseRegistry diamond contract with `cast`:

```
cast call \
--rpc-url $BASE_RPC_URL \
"0x7c0422b31401C936172C897802CF0373B35B7698" \
"currentReward(address)(uint256)" \
"0xa4742402D6E314a069CeB1c3C2C4eFb2982d7D44"

37995641418907243501899 [3.799e22]
```

<Note>
  To convert the current reward to base token units from wei, divide the result by `1e18`.
