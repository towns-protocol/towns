## **Overview**

The Towns Token has three main functions: delegation to Node Operators, Space address delegation, and governance participation.

## **Delegation to Node Operators**

- **Node Operator Delegation**: Node Operators must receive a minimum delegation of Towns Tokens to operate on the network. This requirement ensures operators have a meaningful stake in the network's success and security.
- **Delegation Period**: When tokens are delegated, they enter a 60-day lock-in period after calling the `undelegate()` function. This cooling-off period maintains network stability by giving nodes time to rebalance their stream data if delegated tokens fall below requirements.

## **Space Address Delegation**

- **Direct and Space Delegations**: Users can delegate tokens to either Node Operators or Space addresses. Spaces can then redirect their delegated tokens to specific Nodes, creating flexible delegation options.
- **Voting Power and Delegation**: When delegating to a Space, the Space retains governance voting power while still supporting Node Operators. Direct delegation to Node Operators transfers both operational stake and governance power.
- **Enhanced Features**: Spaces that receive sufficient token delegation unlock additional protocol features, including increased data storage and custom pricing modules that enable free member access.

## **Governance Participation**

- **Voting with Towns Tokens**: Beyond delegation, Towns Tokens enable participation in Towns DAO governance. Token holders help shape the DAO's policies and direction through voting.
- **Balancing Delegation and Governance**: Towns Tokens create a balanced ecosystem by serving dual purposes: supporting network operations and enabling democratic participation.
