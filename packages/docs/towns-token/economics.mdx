## **Inflationary Mechanism**

- **Annual Inflation Rate**: The TOWNS token starts with an 8% annual inflation rate that decreases linearly over 20 years until reaching 2%. This gradual reduction helps control token supply as the network matures and grows.
- **Epoch-Based Distribution**: Every two weeks (one epoch), inflation rewards are distributed equally among active Node Operators. The bi-weekly reward equals the yearly inflation rate divided by 26, creating consistent, predictable rewards for participants.

## **Reward Allocation and Fees**

- **Node Operator Fees**: Node Operators can set their own percentage fee, which is deducted from their allocated inflation rewards each epoch.
- **Distribution to Delegators**: The remaining rewards—after Node Operator fees—are distributed proportionally among the operator's delegators. This system rewards both operators and delegators for maintaining network security and operations.
