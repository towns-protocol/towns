title: "Distribution"

Token reward distribution is a key component of the Towns Network, aligning incentives between Node Operators and network goals.

## **Inflation Schedule**

The first year's inflation of Towns token comes from the existing supply. In subsequent years, inflation occurs annually, starting at 8% and gradually decreasing to 2% over 20 years, following the predefined inflation [**schedule**](https://github.com/river-build/river/blob/main/contracts/scripts/deployments/DeployTownsMainnet.s.sol#L27-L35).

## **Token Inflation**

Inflation is facilitated through the `createInflation()` function, which the DAO can call on Ethereum Mainnet once per year. This function mints the annual token allocation and sends it to a designated contract on Ethereum Mainnet.

## **Token Bridging**

The designated contract automatically bridges these tokens to Base using the `bridgeERC20To()` function, with the Distribution contract address on Base as the destination.

## **Periodic Distribution**

The Distribution contract collects annual rewards and distributes them every two weeks. Each distribution represents 1/26 of the annual supply and is allocated to active operators and delegators through the `distribute()` function.

## **Allocation**

At launch, distributions are split equally among all approved active Node Operators. Each operator receives their specified commission, as set in the Node Operator Registry contract.

The remaining tokens, after commission, are distributed proportionally among delegators who have delegated to that operator for the entire period.

<Note>
  Delegators entering in the middle of a period will not be eligible for rewards until the following period.
