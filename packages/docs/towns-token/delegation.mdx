title: "Delegation"
---

Towns tokens follow the [**ERC20Votes**](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#ERC20Votes) standard and can be delegated to Node Operators on Base or Ethereum Mainnet to participate in rewards [**distribution**](https://docs.towns.com/towns-token/distribution).

**Base Mainnet**

Towns tokens are used in the Node Operator Registry and Towns DAO contracts on [**Base**](https://base.org/).

To delegate tokens, call the `delegate()` function on the Base [**Towns.sol**](https://github.com/river-build/river/blob/main/contracts/src/tokens/river/base/Towns.sol) contract. A user interface is available at [**https://river.build/delegate**](https://river.build/delegate**).

Connect your wallet, paste the address of the Node Operator or Space address you want to delegate to, and submit the transaction.

<Info>
  Always check that your Node Operator address is a valid node operator in the network. You can verify this by checking the node status page at https://river.build/status.

To claim tokens earned from network operations, call the **claim()** function from your wallet on the RewardsDistribution.sol contract. A claiming interface will be available at [**https://river.build/claim**](https://river.build/claim).

## Ethereum Mainnet

You can also delegate TOWNS tokens held on Ethereum mainnet through [**https://river.build/delegate**](https://river.build/delegate**).

After delegation, your details (delegating wallet, operator wallet, and token quantity) are bridged to the Base network and recorded in the Node Operator Registry using the [**L1CrossDomainMessenger**](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/app-developers/bridging/messaging) contract.

<Warning>
  Note that tokens earned from network operations can only be claimed on Base. If your Ethereum mainnet wallet address differs from your Base wallet address, you'll need to authorize your Base wallet to claim tokens on behalf of your Ethereum mainnet wallet. Do this at [**https://river.build/delegate**](https://river.build/delegate) by calling **authorizeClaimer(address)** from your Ethereum mainnet wallet, specifying your Base wallet address as the authorized claimer.
