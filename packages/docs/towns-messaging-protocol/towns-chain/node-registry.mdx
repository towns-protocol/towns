## **Overview and Functionality**

The Node Registry's primary function is to manage the node lifecycleâ€”from onboarding through operational monitoring. Through a rigorous registration process, it ensures each node meets the network's strict performance and reliability standards. The Node Registry serves as a gatekeeper, preserving the network's integrity and efficiency.

### **Registration and Verification**

Registration and verification form the core of the Node Registry. New nodes undergo a thorough evaluation of their performance and security standards. This crucial process maintains the network's high-quality infrastructure by ensuring each node is both capable and trustworthy. The requirements can evolve based on protocol incentives and operator demand.

### **Node Management and Performance Monitoring**

After network integration, nodes undergo continuous performance and activity monitoring. This oversight ensures nodes stay operational and efficient while providing vital data for assessing network health. The Node Registry's management role is essential for maintaining network robustness and responsiveness.

### **Deployment**

The Node Registry operates on Base, enabling seamless interaction with cross-chain entitlement and governance contracts. Essential information bridges between Base and Towns Chain.

## **Integration and Role within the Towns Chain**

The Node Registry is deeply woven into the Towns Chain's fabric. As a smart contract, it harnesses blockchain's immutability and transparency. This integration serves vital purposes:

- **Coordination with Stream Registry**: The Node Registry collaborates with the Stream Registry to ensure efficient node allocation across the Towns Messaging Protocol's streams.
- **Upholding Decentralization and Security**: Through decentralized node management, the Node Registry strengthens the network's distributed architecture, reinforcing security and resilience.
