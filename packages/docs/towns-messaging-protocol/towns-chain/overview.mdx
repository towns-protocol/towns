# Towns Chain: Overview

## **Introduction**

Towns Chain is an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain built on OP-Stack with Celestia DA that ensures consensus and data integrity for streams. This section explains Towns Chain's key aspects and its essential role within the Towns Messaging Protocol ecosystem.

## **Core Functionality**

### **Layer 2 Blockchain**

- **Roll-up to Ethereum**: Towns Chain operates as a Layer 2 solution that rolls up to Ethereum, leveraging the main chain's security while providing better scalability and efficiency.
- **OP-Stack w/ Celestia DA**: The chain uses OP-Stack with Celestia DA, benefiting from its battle-tested Layer 2 infrastructure and future interoperability potential.

### **Smart Contract Integration**

- **Stream Registry Contract**: Manages Stream Node allocation and operation, which is vital to the messaging process.
- **Node Registry Contract**: Handles node registration and management, ensuring a robust and distributed network infrastructure.

## **Scalability and Efficiency**

- **High Throughput**: Handles large message volumes with minimal latency for seamless messaging.
- **Resource Optimization**: Uses Layer 2 efficiency to keep transaction costs low and resource usage sustainable.
