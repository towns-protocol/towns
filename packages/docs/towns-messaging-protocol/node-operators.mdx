title: "Node Operators"

## **Registration and Delegation**

- **Node Registry Contract**: Node Operators start by calling the `register` function on the Node Registry contract deployed on Base. This registers them in the system and begins their operational journey.
- **Soliciting Delegation**: After registration, Node Operators can seek delegation to their address. Token holders show their trust by delegating tokens to operators they endorse.

## **Approval Process**

- **Petitioning the DAO**: Once Node Operators have sufficient delegation, they petition the DAO for approval. The DAO reviews whether the operator meets network standards and guidelines.
- **DAO Approval**: Upon DAO approval, the Node Operator joins the active set on the River Registry contract on Towns Chain, becoming a trusted network entity.

## **Node Management**

- **Adding Individual Nodes**: Approved Node Operators can add and configure individual Nodes to perform network functions.
- **Node States**: Nodes can exist in several states:
  - **Idle**: New Nodes start here, present in the network but not yet active.
  - **Unattached State**: Nodes relay requests without managing specific streams. They have no dedicated storage and serve auxiliary functions.
  - **Attached State**: The Node becomes fully operational, managing new streams and handling data storage, processing, and relay functions.
  - **Exiting**: The Node signals its planned departure and begins transferring stream data to other active nodes.
