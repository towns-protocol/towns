# User Event Lifecycle

This section outlines how user events flow through the protocol, with each step ensuring secure and reliable data transmission.

 1. **Initiation of Event**: An event begins when a user takes action-- such as sending a message or joining a channel.
 2. **Payload Construction**: The system builds a payload describing the action. For messages and other sensitive data, encryption is applied.
 3. **Reference to Previous Mini Block Hash**: The payload includes the previous mini block's hash to maintain the event chain.
 4. **Signing the Event**: The user signs the payload to create an event, establishing its authenticity.
 5. **Transmission via RPC**: The event travels to a connected node through Remote Procedure Call protocols.
 6. **Routing Event Based on StreamId**: The receiving node routes the event to a responsible node using Stream Registry lookups.
 7. **Validation by Responsible Node**: The responsible node checks the event signature, entitlements, and consistency-- including verification of the mini block hash reference.
 8. **Propagation or Rejection**: Valid events are shared with other nodes in the same StreamId; invalid events are rejected.
 9. **Reception and Verification by Other Nodes**: Receiving nodes perform validation checks, with potential future options to delay checks when using a validation gadget.
10. **Local Commitment and Mini-Pool Placement**: Nodes store the event locally and add it to their mini-pools, with final event ordering determined during mini block creation.
11. **Mini Block Creation**: Mini-pools are processed into mini blocks in sync with the Towns Chain, maintaining system continuity.
