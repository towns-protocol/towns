The Towns DAO thrives through its diverse ecosystem of stakeholders, each essential to the protocol's governance and evolution. This section examines the key stakeholders, their roles, and their impact on the DAO ecosystem.

## **Types of Stakeholders**

### **Town Owner NFT Holders**

Wallets holding Town Owner NFTs that meet minimum requirements can vote on proposals in the governance process.

### **Node Operator NFT Holders**

Each registered Node receives a Node Operator NFT. Once a Node remains active for the minimum required period, its wallet gains proposal voting rights.

### **Token Holders**

Token Holders own Towns Tokens (TOWNS) and serve as primary stakeholders. Their voting power on proposals helps shape the protocol's development, while their token ownership aligns with the protocol's long-term success.

### **Developers and Contributors**

As the technical foundation of Towns DAO, developers and contributors maintain the protocol's codebase, implement DAO-approved changes, and ensure secure, efficient Towns Contracts. They collaborate through open-source development, bringing varied expertise to the protocol.

### **Governance Participants**

These active community members engage in proposals and voting. Though they may hold fewer tokens, their participation in discussions and community events enriches the governance process and helps guide the DAO's direction.

### **Partners and Integrators**

Partners and Integrators—including businesses, platforms, and projects—work with the Towns Protocol. Their use cases, adoption, and feedback shape the protocol's development and real-world impact.

### **Advisory Entities**

These experienced individuals and organizations provide strategic guidance to the DAO. While they lack direct voting power, their expertise in blockchain, governance, and compliance proves essential for sound decision-making.

## **Stakeholder Interactions and Impact**

The dynamic interplay between stakeholders creates a balanced, robust governance system. Each group contributes unique value, ensuring decisions are technically sound while serving the ecosystem's broader needs and future growth.
