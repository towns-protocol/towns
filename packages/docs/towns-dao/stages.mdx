### **Proposal Eligibility**

Eligible participants in the governance process include:

1. **Space Owner NFT Holders**: Must have more than 100 fee-contributing members
2. **Node Operator NFT Holders**: Must maintain visible activity for over 30 days

### **Proposal Initiation**

- **Group 1**: Space Owner NFT holders with Spaces of at least 200 members
- **Group 2**: Node Operator NFT holders with 'active' status for at least 30 days

Either group's members can submit proposals for consideration.

### **Voting Phase**

Space Owner and Node Operator NFT holders can vote on proposals.

## **Special Provisions**

- **Subgroup Decisions**: Designated subgroups can handle smaller decisions with specific permissions and treasury allocations
- **On-chain Upgrades**: The DAO can upgrade any on-chain component, including Node Registry requirements, Membership Token minting fees, and Space Factory contract operations

## **Towns Token and DAO Governance**

The Towns token functions as the ecosystem's governance token, serving to:

1. Incentivize node operators and users
2. Enable long-term growth and governance
3. Manage fee and treasury fund allocation

## **Contract Upgrades and Verification**

- **Upgrade Flexibility**: While Towns contracts can be upgraded for enhanced functionality or security, Spaces can opt out of future upgrades to maintain their current setup
- **Verification and Development**: All contracts are verified on [**BaseScan**](https://basescan.org/) and built using [**Forge**](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std) and [**Foundry**](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) tools. Space Owner NFTs and Node Operator NFTs enable active participation in Towns DAO Governance
