Proposals are the cornerstone of the Towns DAO, enabling stakeholders to suggest and decide on changes and improvements. This section explains how ideas become concrete changes in the Towns Protocol.

## **Proposal Lifecycle**

### **Submission**

Any stakeholder can submit a proposal, but it must meet specific criteria—including clear purpose, feasibility, and alignment with the protocol's vision. Submitters need to hold a minimum amount of Towns Tokens (RVR) to ensure they're invested in the protocol's success.

### **Discussion**

After submission, stakeholders discuss the proposal's merits and potential impacts. This crucial phase allows the community to share diverse perspectives and refine the proposal based on feedback.

### **Voting**

Qualifying proposals advance to voting, where RVR holders cast votes weighted by their token holdings. This ensures decision-making power reflects stakeholders' investment in the protocol.

### **Approval and Implementation**

Proposals must achieve a set percentage of positive votes for approval. Once approved, developers and contributors implement the necessary changes to the Towns Protocol.

## **Types of Proposals**

### **Protocol Upgrades**

These proposals focus on improving the Towns Protocol's functionality, security, or efficiency. They require thorough technical analysis and testing.

### **Governance Changes**

These proposals modify the DAO's structure or processes, such as voting systems or submission criteria.

### **Community Initiatives**

These proposals aim to boost community engagement through marketing, education, or development projects.

## **Transparency and Record-Keeping**

The blockchain permanently records all proposals, discussions, and voting results. This creates an auditable history that builds trust in the governance process.

The Towns DAO proposal process exemplifies decentralized governance—it's structured yet adaptable, ensuring every stakeholder can help shape the protocol's future.
