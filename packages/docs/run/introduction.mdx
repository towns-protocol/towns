### **Operating Towns Components**

[**Towns Stream Nodes**](https://github.com/river-build/river/tree/main/core/node) are software components anyone can run. The Towns Protocol treats node operators as first-class participants in the network through its incentive structure. Once registered and approved by the DAO, operators can run a Stream Node on Towns Chain to participate in block validation and earn rewards.

Thanks to River's open-source nature, the Foundation welcomes developers to experiment with running Towns Chain instances on their chosen networks using self-hosted Stream Nodes. While these nodes won't connect to the official Towns protocol network on [**Base Mainnet**](https://basescan.org/), developers can explore various rollup implementation features.

### **Operator Onboarding Lifecycle**

To ensure operators are fully prepared, we've created a structured onboarding process that verifies all [**requirements**](https://docs.towns.com/run/node-operator/system-requirements-installation) for running a mainnet node.

Here are the key steps, each detailed in later sections:

#### Stream Node Configuration Modes

The below table outlines the current operator service level that is supported by the Towns Protocol. Supported configurations are outlined in subsequent sections.

| Configuration | Description                                                                                      | Node Registration | Stream Reads | Stream Writes | Support           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Full node     | Stream node running inside Towns node network                                                    | required          | yes          | yes           | supported         |
| Info mode     | Stream node running in info mode, unattached to the network, for debug purposes only.            | no                | no           | no            | supported         |
| Archival node | Stream node running outside Towns node network storing all stream events from Towns node network | no                | proxied      | proxied       | not yet supported |
