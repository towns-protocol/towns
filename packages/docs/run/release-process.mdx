description: "Release Process and Guidelines for Towns Protocol Node Operators"

Towns protocol follows a weekly release schedule for both testnet and mainnet environments. Stream node images are built and published to the [**Towns Docker ECR**](https://public.ecr.aws/h5v6m2x1/river), with announcements made in the #releases channel of the [**Towns Operator Town**](/9185fe981f0000000000000000000000).

## Release Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Testnet Upgrade">
    Each Monday by 11pm UTC, we release a new testnet version from the latest alpha release candidate tag to the Towns Docker ECR. The release uses the version format **testnet/YYYY-MM-DD-##**. Each docker image receives two tags: a mutable **testnet** tag and an immutable commit sha tag.

    <br />

    <Note>
      Operators are encouraged to monitor the river [repo](https://github.com/river-build/river) for `testnet*` prefixed tags to upgrade nodes running in testnet.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mainnet Upgrade">
    Each Tuesday by 11pm UTC, we deploy a new mainnet release using the same commit sha from the previous day's testnet deployment. The release uses the version format **mainnet/YYYY-MM-DD-##**. Each docker image receives two tags: a mutable **mainnet** tag and an immutable commit sha tag.

    <br />

    <Note>
      Operators are asked to ensure mainnet images are upgraded by eod Tuesday to ensure homogeneity of software versions running in mainnet.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hotfix">
    For critical issues, we release hotfixes to the Towns Docker ECR with four tags: **hotfix**, **mainnet**, **testnet**, and the commit sha.
    Hotfixes will be explicitly communicated to operators to upgrade their nodes in the Towns Operator Town, `testnet` nodes first followed by `mainnet`.
