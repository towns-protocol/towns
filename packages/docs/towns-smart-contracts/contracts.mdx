## Current Deployment of Towns Protocol Smart Contracts

### **Overview**

This section details the current deployment status of Towns Protocol's core smart contracts.

### **Key Smart Contracts**

All Towns smart contracts use the Diamond Pattern (see [**EIP-2525**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535)) to enhance modularity and upgradeability.

These are the deployed diamond contracts on Base, with links to their respective facet addresses:

| Diamond      | Network | Address                                    | Facet Addresses |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| SpaceFactory | Base    | 0x9978c826d93883701522d2CA645d5436e5654252 |                 |
| SpaceOwner   | Base    | 0x2824D1235d1CbcA6d61C00C3ceeCB9155cd33a42 |                 |
| Space        | Base    | 0x34f35E1ECA9C00791bF8121A01c20977d8bEB11C |                 |
| BaseRegistry | Base    | 0x7c0422b31401C936172C897802CF0373B35B7698 |                 |

### **Accessing and Interacting with the Contracts**

These Base contract addresses enable direct interaction with the Towns ecosystem. Developers and users can leverage these contracts to create Spaces, manage memberships, and implement pricing strategies.
