## **Understanding Roles, Entitlements, and Permissions in Towns Protocol**

### **Overview of Permissions**

In the Towns ecosystem, `Permissions` define specific actions users can take within a `Space`. These permissions govern all user interactions and activities. Here are the key permissions:

- `ModifyChannels`: Allows holders to create, delete, edit, and assign roles to channels within a Space.
- `ModifyRoles`: Enables users to create and modify roles and entitlements within a Space.
- `MintMembership`: Grants users the ability to mint membership tokens for a Space.
- `Read`: Allows users to access and view messages within a Space.
- `Write`: Enables users to create and modify messages within a Space.

### **Concept of Roles**

`Roles` bundle multiple `Permissions` together, making it easier to manage user access and capabilities within a Space.

### **Functionality of Entitlements**

`Entitlements` determine which users are eligible for different Roles. These can apply to specific Channels or the entire Space.

### **Implementation of Entitlement Modules**

`Entitlement Modules` define the requirements for Entitlements. Like pricing modules, they allow custom smart contracts on the chain. These contracts must follow the `IEntitlement` Interface and deploy to Base, with configurable settings for each Space.

### **Default Settings in Spaces**

When a new Space is minted, it comes with two standard Entitlement Modules:

1. **UserEntitlementModule**: Assigns Roles based on specific addresses or ENS names—for example, you could give "vitalik.eth" a Moderator Role or "0x44..ccbb" a Read-Only Role.
2. **TokenEntitlementModule**: Assigns Roles based on on-chain asset ownership—for example, you could give a Special Role to Cryptopunk holders or a Whale Role to users with at least 0.1 ETH.

### **Default Roles in Newly Minted Spaces**

Every new Space starts with two predefined Roles:

- Owner:
  - Assigned automatically to the Owner NFT holder through the Token Entitlement Module.
  - This Role includes all permissions and cannot be revoked.
- Member:
  - Granted to any Member NFT holder.
  - Includes basic "Read" and "Write" Permissions by default.
