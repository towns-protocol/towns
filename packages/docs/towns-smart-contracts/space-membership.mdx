### Overview

Space Membership centers on Membership Tokens, which are fundamental to the Towns Protocol. These tokens represent on-chain memberships that grant holders specific access rights and interaction capabilities within a Space.

**Subscription Model:** Memberships have a one-year duration and can be renewed at the original purchase price, not the current market rate. This protects early members from price increases while adding value to the membership token.

**Configurable Supply:** Space owners control the supply of Membership Tokens, allowing them to customize their community's size and exclusivity.

**Flexible Pricing Models:** Space owners can implement either fixed prices or custom pricing schemes through code. See the \[Pricing Modules\] section for more details.

**Access Control Mechanisms:** Membership Tokens support gating based on specific [**ERC-20**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) or [**ERC-721**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) tokens across Ethereum Mainnet, Optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Base networks, creating a versatile access system.

**Custom Entitlement Logic:** Beyond standard token gating, Membership Tokens can incorporate custom logic based on factors like on-chain game scores or DeFi protocol liquidity. Integration with on-chain oracles enables access control based on real-world events. These rules can be deployed on any supported chain. See \[Entitlement Modules\] for more details.

**Reputation System:** Members can earn reputation from other participants within their Space, creating a community-driven environment where interactions shape standing. See the \[Reputation\] section for more information.

**Token Standards and Composability:** Membership Tokens follow the [**ERC-721**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) standard, ensuring smooth integration with other blockchain components and broad ecosystem compatibility.
