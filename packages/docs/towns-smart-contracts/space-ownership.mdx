## **Space Ownership**

Space Ownership in Towns uses a unique token-based system that provides direct, transferable control over Spaces. This section explains how Space Ownership works, including fund management, ownership transfer, and security features.

### **Creation and Ownership**

- **Token Minting**: When someone creates a Space on Base, they receive a special on-chain token that grants complete ownership of that Space.
- **Ownership Rights**: Space contracts automatically recognize the token holder as the Owner. This enables flexible ownershipâ€”the token can be transferred or controlled by decentralized entities like DAOs or multisig wallets.

### **Financial Management**

- **Funds Management**: All Membership minting funds flow directly to a contract controlled by the ownership NFT. Through ERC6551, the NFT holder maintains exclusive control over these funds.

### **Transfer and Security**

- **Space Sale**: Owners can transfer their Space by simply transferring their NFT, which automatically transfers all ownership privileges.
- **Enhanced Security**: Spaces can be secured in multisig wallets or managed by DAOs, enabling collaborative control and decision-making.
- **Guardian Module**: A safety feature that prevents immediate Owner token transfers if a holding wallet is compromised.
- **Interface Implementation**: The Space Owner NFT implements, ensuring compatibility with blockchain standards and ecosystem interoperability.
