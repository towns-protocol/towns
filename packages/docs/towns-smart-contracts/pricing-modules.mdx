## Custom Pricing Modules in Spaces

### **Overview**

Spaces in the Towns ecosystem can define custom pricing strategies through pricing modules. These smart contracts follow the `IPricingModule` Interface to determine membership prices based on various attributes.

### **Implementation of Custom Pricing Modules**

Custom pricing modules must implement the `IPricingModule` Interface. The interface's `getPrice` function calculates prices using criteria like total memberships minted or other programmable attributes. See \[Recipes\] for examples.

### **Default Pricing Modules in Every Space**

Each new Space comes with two default pricing modules:

1. **Dynamic Pricing Module** (default setting):
   - **Pricing Strategy**: Prices adjust based on member count
   - **Price Calculation**: Price increases logarithmicallyâ€”approaching $10 USD at 1,000 members, then $100 USD at 10,000 members
   - **Price Cap**: Maximum price is $100 USD
   - **Initial Offer**: First 100 memberships are free
   - **Payment Method**: Accepts ETH
   - **Reference**: See `DynamicPricing.sol` for details
2. **Flat Fee Price**:
   - **Fixed Pricing**: Simple fixed-price strategy
   - **Minimum Price**: $10 USD per membership
   - **Payment Method**: Accepts ETH

### **Transaction Fee Distribution**

Transaction fees are distributed among three key stakeholders:

- **Space Owner**: Receives a portion of fees as incentive for Space management and growth
- **Towns DAO**: Receives a share to support Towns Lodge development and sustainability
- **Referrers**: Earn rewards for bringing in new members, available for both Space members and client referrals
