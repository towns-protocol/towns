## Custom Pricing Modules in Spaces

### Overview

In the Towns ecosystem, Spaces have the flexibility to define their own pricing strategies through custom pricing modules. These modules are smart contracts that comply with the `IPricingModule` Interface and are responsible for determining the price of memberships based on various attributes.

### Implementation of Custom Pricing Modules

To implement a custom pricing module, a contract must adhere to the `IPricingModule` Interface. This interface includes the `getPrice` function, which can be programmed to calculate prices based on different criteria, such as the total number of memberships minted or other programmable attributes. See more examples in [Recipes].

### Default Pricing Modules in Every Space

Every newly deployed Space in the Towns ecosystem is equipped with two default pricing modules:

1. **Dynamic Pricing Module** (default setting):

   - **Pricing Strategy**: This module adopts a dynamic pricing approach, where the price is influenced by the number of members in the Space.
   - **Price Calculation**: The price logarithmically approaches \$10 USD as membership reaches 1,000, and then again increases logarithmically to approach \$100 USD as membership reaches 10,000.
   - **Price Cap**: Membership prices never exceed $100 USD.
   - **Initial Offer**: The first 100 memberships are offered for free.
   - **Payment Method**: Accepts ETH as payment.
   - **Reference**: For more details, see `DynamicPricing.sol`.

2. **Flat Fee Price**:
   - **Fixed Pricing**: This module implements a straightforward fixed pricing strategy.
   - **Minimum Price**: Sets a minimum price of $10 USD for a membership.
   - **Payment Method**: Also accepts ETH as payment.

### Protocol Fee Structure

When users purchase memberships, the Towns protocol collects a fee from the membership payment to support ecosystem infrastructure and development.

#### Current Fee Configuration
- **Protocol Fee Rate**: 10% of membership payment
- **Minimum Protocol Fee**: 0.0005 ETH
- **Price Threshold**: 0.001 ETH
- **Free Membership Allocation**: 1,000 memberships per Space

#### Fee Collection Logic

The protocol fee is deducted from the membership payment using a two-tier system:

1. **Below Threshold**: If membership price < 0.001 ETH → Protocol takes 0.0005 ETH
2. **Above Threshold**: If membership price ≥ 0.001 ETH → Protocol takes 10% of the payment

#### Revenue Distribution Examples

| Membership Price | Protocol Fee | Space Owner Receives |
|------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| 0 ETH (Free) | 0 ETH | 0 ETH |
| 0.0005 ETH | 0.0005 ETH | 0 ETH |
| 0.001 ETH | 0.0001 ETH (10%) | 0.0009 ETH |
| 0.01 ETH | 0.001 ETH (10%) | 0.009 ETH |
| 0.1 ETH | 0.01 ETH (10%) | 0.09 ETH |

**Note**: The protocol fee is automatically deducted from membership payments. Space owners receive the remainder after the protocol fee is collected.

### Transaction Fee Distribution

An essential aspect of the pricing modules is the distribution of fees from transactions. These fees are split among key stakeholders:

- **Space Owner**: A portion of the fees is allocated to the SpaceOwner, providing an incentive for maintaining and growing the Space.
- **Towns DAO**: A share of the fees contribute to the Towns Lodge, supporting the overall development and sustainability of the ecosystem.
- **Referrers**: Referrers, if any, are also rewarded, encouraging community growth and engagement. Referrers can be set for both members of a Space as well as for the client being used to interact with the protocol.
