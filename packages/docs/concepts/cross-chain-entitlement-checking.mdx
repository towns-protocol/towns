title: "Cross Chain Entitlements"
---

### **Overview**

Cross Chain Entitlement Checking allows Towns Protocol to verify entitlements stored on blockchains beyond Base. Currently, this includes the EVM chains Ethereum Mainnet, Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon, with plans to add more chains in the future.

### **Use Cases**

1. **Asset Requirements Across Chains:** A Space can require members to hold specific assets on different chains—for example, a Crypto Punk on Ethereum Mainnet and a Degod on Polygon.
2. **Asset Quantity Requirements:** A Space can require users to hold a minimum amount of assets—for example, more than 5 ETH across their linked wallets.

### **Entitlement Checks for Permissions**

Cross Chain Entitlement Checks control permissions like Read, Write, or Mint. However, permissions that require direct contract transactions, like channel creation or role assignment, must use entitlements based on Base Chain assets only.

### **Process for Minting a Member NFT**

1. **Join Request:** A user requests to join a Space through the smart contract.
2. **Membership Fee Verification:** The contract checks if the user has paid any required membership fee.
3. **Cross-Chain Requirement Assessment:** The contract checks if the Space requires cross-chain entitlement verification.
4. **Broadcasting the Request:** For cross-chain checks, the contract broadcasts an event to a randomly selected node from the active node registry.
5. **Node Processing:** The selected node retrieves the Space's entry requirements from the contract.
6. **Wallet Link and Evaluation:** The node checks all of the user's linked wallets to verify they meet the Space's criteria.
7. **Minting Member NFT:** After successful verification, the node signals the smart contract to mint the Space's Member NFT to the user's address.
