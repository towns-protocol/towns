title: "Network Partitioning"
---

During complete network partitioning, if a majority of nodes are in one partition, that partition continues processing the stream and producing blocks, while nodes in the minority partition stall. A future upgrade could potentially prevent this stalling behavior. In cases of partial partitioning—where stream nodes can't directly communicate with others in their group but a connected path exists between all nodes—the stream continues functioning normally through active minipool reconciliation. Nodes automatically fetch missing events when they detect an unknown hash in a NodeToNode.NewEventInPool operation.
