Stream Checkpointing ensures data integrity in the Towns Protocol by recording stream data on a secure L2 blockchain. This guide explains the process, with a focus on mini block headers and their role in the protocol.

## **Mini Block Headers**

Mini block headers provide a compact summary of block contents, containing the key information needed to verify transaction integrity and finality.

### **Components of a Mini Block Header**

Each mini block header is an event containing these essential elements:

1. **Hash of Previous Mini Block Header**: Creates a chain of linked blocks for continuity and traceability.
2. **Hashes of Events**: References to the current mini block's events, summarizing its contents.
3. **Snapshots (0-1)**: Optional snapshots that provide additional context or state information \[see Snapshotting\].
4. **Vote Proof**: Consensus evidence from participating nodes that confirms the mini block's validity.
5. **Signature**: The leader node's signature of the entire event, ensuring security and authenticity.

### **Storage and Distribution**

- **Local Storage by Nodes**: All participating nodes store mini block headers locally to maintain network integrity and redundancy.
- **Sent to Clients**: Clients receive mini block headers to verify transaction finality and integrity.

## **Finality and Verification**

Transaction finality in the Towns Protocol is essential for system trust, with mini block headers playing a key role:

- **Transaction Finality**: A transaction is final when a client or node has both the mini block header and matching header hash on the Towns Chain.
- **Verification Process**: Mini block headers form an interconnected chain that, combined with consensus proofs and node signatures, enables thorough verification of data integrity.
