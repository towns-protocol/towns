## **Rebalancing in Distributed Systems**

In distributed systems, rebalancing prevents nodes from becoming overloaded, especially when nodes join or leave the network. The system must handle two distinct scenarios: when a node crashes unexpectedly and when it exits cleanly.

For effective rebalancing, the system needs both a signal to detect node exits and logic to redistribute the load. While the rebalancing logic can be built into a smart contract, detecting node exits in a decentralized system poses a greater challenge. Research is underway to develop methods for nodes to autonomously detect crash exits through peer communication, aiming for a fully decentralized solution.

Currently, the system uses a hybrid approach where "watchers" within the Towns DAO monitor the network and signal when rebalancing is neededâ€”particularly after node crashes or unexpected exits. This serves as an interim solution while more autonomous and decentralized methods are in development.
