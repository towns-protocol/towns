title: "Chunk Management"
---

Efficient resource allocation in distributed systems is crucial to prevent node overburden, especially in stream processing. To address hotspots—where some nodes handle highly active streams while others process less active ones—the system will implement stream chunking. When a stream chunk reaches a predetermined size, it transfers to a new set of nodes. Though not in the initial implementation but planned for the immediate roadmap, this approach ensures more balanced processing loads across nodes. Each chunk maintains the current system's replication factor of five, just as entire streams do now. This strategy optimizes resource utilization and improves the distributed system's overall efficiency.
