## **Server-Side Event Processing Workflow**

When a node receives an event envelope through NodeToNode.NewEventReceived RPC, it first validates the action's permissions. For example, it checks if a chat message sender is a member of the target channel. If validation fails, the node returns an error. If successful, the node adds the event to the stream's minipool and saves it to local storage. The node then sends a success response to the original RPC call and broadcasts a NodeToNode.NewEventInPool message (containing the event hash) to all stream nodes except the original caller. Once a majority of minipools have the event—calculated from the local minipool plus received NodeToNode.NewEventInPool messages—the node sends the event to all clients monitoring that stream via Sync RPC.
