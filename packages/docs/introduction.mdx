### **What is Towns Protocol?**

Towns Protocol is an open-source protocol for building decentralized real-time messaging apps. It combines an EVM-compatible L2 chain, decentralized off-chain stream nodes, and smart contracts deployed on Base. The protocol enables permissionless creation of programmable communication spaces called "Spaces." These Spaces are ownable assets that include on-chain subscriptions ("Memberships"), an extendable reputation system, and end-to-end message encryption.

### **Purpose and Vision**

At its core, the ecosystem empowers people to create, manage, and participate in digital communities in a secure and permissionless manner. It provides a robust, decentralized platform where users maintain complete control over their data, privacy, and community engagement while protecting their reputation. The vision is to foster user-centric, community-driven digital social interactions, using blockchain technology to ensure trust and security.

Towns's goal is ambitious: to secure freedom of communication for a sustainable, permissionless future.

### **Key features**

**An app chain purposefully built for social networking** – Towns handles read/write entitlements separately on Base, allowing our app chain to optimize for speed and send messages to thousands of participants as quickly as centralized social networks.

**Ownable communication** – Space creators truly own their created space as an on-chain asset.

**Programmable spaces** – Spaces are deployed on-chain with programmable interfaces, allowing customization of rules like read and write permissions to integrate with any external EVM-compatible contract.

**On-chain memberships with built-in protocol fees** – Users must hold a valid membership token to send and receive messages in a Space. Membership pricing includes protocol fees that support network operations.

**On-chain social graph** – Membership tokens and Spaces are discoverable on-chain.

**Extendable reputation system** – Towns's communication spaces can enable peer-based, Space-specific ratings discoverable on-chain.

**End-to-end encrypted messaging** – Ensures secure, private communication with advanced encryption, protecting messages between sender and entitled users.

### **High-Level Component Summary**

1. **Towns Smart Contracts**: Deployed on the Base Mainnet Chain, an Ethereum Layer 2 platform, these contracts enable users to create and manage programmable communication spaces. Each space is minted as a unique entity, with the minter receiving an owner token representing their controlling interest. The smart contracts handle membership pricing, gated access, role-based entitlements, and moderation customization for each space.
2. **Towns Protocol**: The backbone for social messaging within the ecosystem. It combines the Towns Chain and Stream Nodes to manage encrypted communications across the network. The protocol ensures secure and private group messaging, maintaining communication integrity within each space.
3. **Towns Lodge**: Towns Lodge governs and stewards the Protocol. It oversees major decisions, protocol upgrades, and node operations through a participatory voting system that balances the interests of Space Owners, Space Members, and Node Operators.
4. **Clients**: Towns is a permissionless protocol meaning anyone can build a client to interact with it. Here’s a list of popular clients already building on Towns Protocol: Towns, Propeller, SendIt + many more to come.
