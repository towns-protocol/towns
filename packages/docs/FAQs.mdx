### **What are the minimum requirements for nodes to enter the Towns network?**

To enter the active set, a Node Operator must register and receive sufficient TOWNS token delegation from the DAO. Once approved, their nodes become eligible to host and serve streams.

The process works like this: the DAO bridges the new Node Operator to the Towns Chain network, after which the operator can register their node with the TownsRegistry contract.

### **When can nodes be removed from the active set?**

The DAO may remove nodes from the active set if they fail to maintain minimum standards for uptime, storage, and network performance.

### **What are the token requirements for Node Operators?**

Node Operators must have between 100 million and 500 million TOWNS tokens delegated to them before they can join the Towns Network.

### **How often are rewards distributed?**

Node Operators and Delegators receive rewards every two weeks.

### **How are rewards divided between Node Operators and Delegators?**

Node Operators receive their set commission rate from the rewards. The remaining rewards are distributed proportionally among delegators who supported that operator for the entire period.
