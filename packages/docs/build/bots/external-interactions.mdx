title: External Interactions
---


Towns bots are built on [Hono](https://hono.dev), a lightweight web framework. While by default `/webhook` endpoint is reserved for receiving Towns events, you can add any number of additional routes for:

- **External webhooks** - GitHub, Linear, monitoring services
- **Custom APIs** - REST endpoints for third-party integrations
- **Scheduled tasks** - Timers that run periodically
- **Health checks** - Status endpoints for monitoring

The bot instance get from `makeTownsBot` contains all the methods you can use to interact with your bot.

This allows you to perform actions that are not triggered by Towns events, such as letting other services trigger actions on your bot.

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { makeTownsBot } from '@towns-protocol/bot'

const bot = await makeTownsBot(privateData, jwtSecret)
await bot.start()

const app = new Hono()

app.post('/api/post-message', async (c) => {
  const { channelId, message } = await c.req.json()
  await bot.sendMessage(channelId, message)
  return c.json({ ok: true })
})
```

Or fetch data from external APIs and send messages to channels.

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { makeTownsBot } from '@towns-protocol/bot'

const bot = await makeTownsBot(privateData, jwtSecret)
await bot.start()

const app = new Hono()

const channels: string[] = []
bot.onSlashCommand('/set-channel', async (handler, event) => {
  const { channelId } = event
  channels.push(channelId)
  await handler.sendMessage(channelId, 'Channel set successfully')
})

setInterval(async () => {
  const tokenPrice = await fetchTokenPriceApi('ETH')
  for (const channelId of channels) {
    await bot.sendMessage(channelId, "ðŸ’° ETH update: $" + tokenPrice)
  }
}, 60_000)
```
