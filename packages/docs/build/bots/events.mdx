---

This guide covers what you need to know about events and how to handle them in your bot. You'll learn about:

- [Event anatomy](#event-anatomy)
- [Event listeners](#event-listeners)
- [Sending events](#sending-events)
- [Permissions](#permissions)
- [Moderation](#moderation)
- [Snapshot data](#snapshot-data)

## Event Anatomy

All events share a common `BasePayload` structure:

- `userId`: The user who triggered the event.
- `spaceId`: The space that the event occurred in.
- `channelId`: The channel that the event occurred in.
- `eventId`: The unique event ID.
- `createdAt`: The date and time the event occurred.

Different event types extend this base with additional fields.

## Event Listeners
All event listeners are asynchronous functions that receive a `handler` and an `event` object. 

The `handler` is the bot instance and the `event` contains the `BasePayload` and additional fields specific to the event type.

### onMessage

Fires when a message is sent in a channel the bot is in (subject to forwarding settings).

- `message`: The decrypted message text.
- `replyId`: The `eventId` of the message being replied to (if reply).
- `threadId`: The `eventId` of the thread's first message (if in thread).
- `mentions`: List of users mentioned in the message. Each mention contains the user's address and display name.
- `isMentioned`: True if the bot was @mentioned.

### onSlashCommand

Fires when a user invokes one of your bot's slash commands. For more information about slash commands, see the [Slash Commands guide](/build/bot/slash-commands).

- `command`: The name of the command invoked by the user.
- `args`: The arguments passed to the command.
- `mentions`: List of users mentioned in the command.
- `replyId`: The message being replied to (if any).
- `threadId`: The thread context (if any).

### onReaction

<Warning>
You only get the `reaction` and `messageId` - not the message content! Store messages externally if you need context.
</Warning>

- `reaction`: The reaction emoji.
- `messageId`: The `eventId` of the message being reacted to.

### onMessageEdit

Fires when a message is edited.

- `message`: The new message content.
- `refEventId`: The `eventId` of the message being edited.
- `replyId`: If the edited message was a reply.
- `threadId`: If the edited message was in a thread.
- `mentions`: Array of mentioned users in the edited message.
- `isMentioned`: True if the bot is mentioned in the edited message.

### onRedaction

Fires when a message is deleted by a user.

- `refEventId`: The `eventId` of the message being deleted.

### onEventRevoke

- `refEventId`: The `eventId` of the message being revoked.

### onTip

Fires when a user sends a cryptocurrency tip on a message.

- `messageId`: The `eventId` of the message that received the tip.
- `senderAddress`: The address of the user who sent the tip.
- `receiverAddress`: The address of the user who received the tip.
- `amount`: The amount of the tip.
- `currency`: The currency of the tip.

It can fire for any tip, not just tips to the bot.


### onChannelJoin 

Fires when users join a channel.

- `userId`: The user who joined or left the channel.
- `channelId`: The channel that the user joined or left.

### onChannelLeave

Fires when users leave a channel.

- `userId`: The user who left the channel.
- `channelId`: The channel that the user left.

## Sending events

You can use bot actions to send events to Towns Network.

### sendMessage

Send a message to a channel.
```ts
const { eventId } = await bot.sendMessage(channelId, message, opts)
```
- `channelId`: The channel to send the message to.
- `message`: The message to send.
- `opts`: The options for the message.
  - `threadId`: The thread to send the message to.
  - `replyId`: The message to reply to.
  - `mentions`: The users to mention in the message. Accepts a list of `userId` and `displayName`.
  - `attachments`: The attachments to send with the message.

Returns the `eventId` of the sent message.

#### Sending attachments

The bot framework supports two types of attachments with automatic validation and encryption.

##### Image Attachments from URLs

Send images by URL with automatic validation and dimension detection:

```ts
await bot.sendMessage(channelId, message, {
  attachments: [
    {
       type: 'image',

       alt: 'Example image'
    } 
  ]
})
```

##### Chunked Media Attachments

Send binary data with a filename and MIME type. 
This allow you to send large files, videos, screenshots or even create images on the fly.

```ts
const imageBuffer = await fs.readFile('image.png')
await bot.sendMessage(channelId, message, {
  attachments: [{ 
    type: 'chunked', 
    data: imageBuffer, 
    filename: 'image.png', 
    mimetype: 'image/png',
    width: 400,
    height: 300,
  }]
})
```

### sendReaction

```ts
await bot.sendReaction(channelId, eventId, reaction)
```
- `channelId`: The channel to send the reaction to.
- `eventId`: The `eventId` of the message to react to.
- `reaction`: The reaction to send.

Returns the `eventId` of the sent reaction.

Example:

```ts
bot.onMessage(async (handler, { channelId, eventId, message }) => {
  if (message.includes('Towns')) {
    await handler.sendReaction(channelId, eventId, 'ðŸ”¥')
  }

```ts
await bot.removeEvent(channelId, eventId)
```
- `channelId`: The channel to remove the event from.
- `eventId`: The `eventId` of the event to remove.

### adminRemoveEvent

```ts
await bot.adminRemoveEvent(channelId, eventId)
```
- `channelId`: The channel to remove the event from.
- `eventId`: The `eventId` of the event to remove.

Returns the `eventId` of the redaction event.

## Permissions

Bots can check user permissions before executing sensitive operations.

### hasAdminPermission

Check if a user has admin permission.

```ts
const isAdmin = await handler.hasAdminPermission(userId, spaceId)
```

### checkPermission

Check if a user has a specific permission.

```ts
const hasPermission = await handler.checkPermission(streamId, userId, permission)
```

## Moderation

Bots can perform moderation actions if they have the `ModifyBanning` permission.

### ban

Ban a user from a space.

```ts
await handler.ban(userId, spaceId)
```

### unban

Unban a user from a space.

```ts
await handler.unban(userId, spaceId)
```

## Snapshot Data

Bots have access to snapshot data for reading channel settings and membership information.

<Warning>
Snapshot data may not reflect the latest state. It's cached and updated periodically.
</Warning>

### getChannelInception

Get channel settings and inception data.

```ts
const channelData = await bot.snapshot.getChannelInception(streamId)
```

### getUserMemberships

Get a user's space memberships.

```ts
const memberships = await bot.snapshot.getUserMemberships(userId)
```

### getSpaceMemberships

Get all members of a space.
