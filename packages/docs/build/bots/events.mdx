---

This guide covers what you need to know about events and how to handle them in your bot. You'll learn about:

- [Event anatomy](#event-anatomy)
- [Event listeners](#event-listeners)

## Event Anatomy

All events share a common `BasePayload` structure:

- `userId`: The user who triggered the event.
- `spaceId`: The space that the event occurred in.
- `channelId`: The channel that the event occurred in.
- `eventId`: The unique event ID.
- `createdAt`: The date and time the event occurred.

Different event types extend this base with additional fields.

## Event Listeners
All event listeners are asynchronous functions that receive a `handler` and an `event` object. 

The `handler` is the bot instance and the `event` contains the `BasePayload` and additional fields specific to the event type.

### onMessage

Fires when a message is sent in a channel the bot is in (subject to forwarding settings).

- `message`: The decrypted message text.
- `replyId`: The `eventId` of the message being replied to (if reply).
- `threadId`: The `eventId` of the thread's first message (if in thread).
- `mentions`: List of users mentioned in the message. Each mention contains the user's address and display name.
- `isMentioned`: True if the bot was @mentioned.

### onSlashCommand

Fires when a user invokes one of your bot's slash commands. For more information about slash commands, see the [Slash Commands guide](/build/bot/slash-commands).

- `command`: The name of the command invoked by the user.
- `args`: The arguments passed to the command.

### onReaction

<Warning>
You only get the `reaction` and `messageId` - not the message content! Store messages externally if you need context.
</Warning>

- `reaction`: The reaction emoji.
- `refEventId`: The `eventId` of the message being reacted to.

### onMessageEdit


- `message`: The new message content.
- `refEventId`: The `eventId` of the message being edited.

### onRedaction

Fires when a message is deleted by a user.

- `refEventId`: The `eventId` of the message being deleted.

### onEventRevoke

- `refEventId`: The `eventId` of the message being revoked.

### onTip

Fires when a user sends a cryptocurrency tip on a message.

- `messageId`: The `eventId` of the message that received the tip.
- `senderAddress`: The address of the user who sent the tip.
- `receiverAddress`: The address of the user who received the tip.
- `amount`: The amount of the tip.
- `currency`: The currency of the tip.

It can fire for any tip, not just tips to the bot.


### onChannelJoin 

Fires when users join a channel.

- `userId`: The user who joined or left the channel.
- `channelId`: The channel that the user joined or left.

### onChannelLeave

Fires when users leave a channel.

- `userId`: The user who left the channel.
- `channelId`: The channel that the user left.

## Sending events

You can use bot actions to send events to Towns Network.

### sendMessage

```ts
const { eventId } = await bot.sendMessage(channelId, message, opts)
```

#### Sending attachments

The bot framework supports two types of attachments with automatic validation and encryption.

##### Image Attachments from URLs

```ts
await bot.sendMessage(channelId, message, {
  attachments: [
    {
       type: 'image',

##### Chunked Media Attachments

Send binary data with a filename and MIME type. 
This allow you to send large files, videos, screenshots or even create images on the fly.

```ts
const imageBuffer = await fs.readFile('image.png')
await bot.sendMessage(channelId, message, {
  attachments: [{ 
    type: 'chunked', 
    data: imageBuffer,
