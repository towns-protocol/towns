Bots in Towns Protocol are programmable applications that can interact with spaces, channels, and users through end-to-end encrypted messaging.

They enable automation, integrations, and enhanced user experiences within Towns communities.

## Architecture

Towns bots consist of two interconnected pieces:

### Onchain Component

Bots are smart contracts registered through the **App Registry** on Base and installed in a `Space`. 

The onchain component provides:
- **Secure identity**: Each bot has a unique address and public key
- **Fine-grained permissions**: Control exactly what the bot can do (read/write messages, ban users, moderate, etc.)
- **Recurring revenue**: Bots can be paid monthly or yearly by spaces that install them
- **ERC-4337 Account Abstraction**: Bots use SimpleAccount contracts enabling advanced onchain interactions
- **Batch execution support**: Execute multiple contract calls atomically using ERC-7821

This allows bots to:
- Have their own wallet address funded with ETH/tokens
- Interact with any smart contract (DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, etc.)
- Execute complex multi-step transactions in one atomic operation
- Receive payments and tips onchain

### Server Component

The server component is a webhook endpoint that receives events from Towns Protocol nodes and processes them.

A bot operates like a specialized user in the Towns Protocol network. It can:
- **Send and receive messages** with full end-to-end encryption
- **React to events** in real-time (messages, tips, joins, leaves)
- **Execute slash commands** with custom logic
- **Moderate channels** (ban/unban users with proper permissions)
- **Check permissions** before executing sensitive operations
- **Access snapshot data** about channels and memberships
- **Receive tips** just like regular users

All of this with the same security guarantees as a user: **end-to-end encryption** for all messages.

Additionally, the server can communicate with the onchain component, allowing it to:
- Read from any smart contract
- Write to contracts using the bot's wallet
- Execute complex DeFi operations (swaps, staking, liquidity provision)
- Mint NFTs, manage DAOs, and interact with any Web3 protocol

## Use Cases

With these capabilities, you can build bots that:

### Communication & Engagement
- AI assistants that answer questions using LLMs
- Welcome bots that greet new members
- Announcement bots for important updates
- Poll and voting systems

### Moderation & Safety
- Auto-moderation based on rules
- Spam detection and prevention
- Content filtering
- User verification systems

### Onchain Integration
- Tip tracking and leaderboards
- Token price monitoring and alerts
- NFT minting and distribution
- DeFi operations (swaps, staking, yield farming)
- DAO proposal notifications and voting

### External Services
- GitHub integration for code updates
- Calendar and meeting reminders
- Weather and news updates
- Custom webhooks from any service
