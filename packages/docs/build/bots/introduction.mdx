Bots in Towns Protocol are programmable applications that can interact with spaces, channels, and users through end-to-end encrypted messaging.

They enable automation, integrations, and enhanced user experiences within Towns communities.

## Architecture

Towns bots consist of two interconnected pieces:

### Onchain 

Bots are a smart contract that is registered through the **App Registry** smart contract on Base and installed in a `Space`. 

It allows us to have:
- **Secure identity**: Each bot has a unique address and public key.
- **Fine-grained permissions**: Control exactly what the bot can do (read/write messages, ban, etc.)
- **Recurring revenue**: Bots can be paid monthly or yearly.
- TODO: add more / rethink the section

### Server 

The server component is a webhook endpoint that receives events from Towns Protocol nodes and processes them.

Bot is a fine-tuned user in the Towns Protocol network. It can do most of the things a user can do: send and receive messages, receive tips, etc. All of that with the same security guarantees as a user: **end-to-end encryption**.

Additionally, the server can talk with the onchain piece, allowing it to perform onchain interactions, transactions, tips, swaps, and more.
