title: Getting Started
---

This guide will walk you through creating, developing, and deploying your first Towns bot. You'll learn how to:

1. [Create a bot in Towns](#create-a-bot)
2. [Set up your development environment](#develop-your-bot)
3. [Deploy to Render.com](#deploy-your-bot)
4. [Configure your bot in Towns](#configure-in-towns)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed (`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`)
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)

## Create a Bot

1. **Visit the Developer Portal**

   Go to [app.towns.com/developer](https://app.towns.com/developer)

2. **Create New Bot**

   Fill in the details and click "Create Bot".

3. **Save Your Credentials**

   After creation, you'll receive two critical values:

   - `APP_PRIVATE_DATA` - Your bot's private key and encryption device (base64 encoded string)
   - `JWT_SECRET` - Used to verify webhook requests from Towns servers

<Note>
   Store these securely - you'll need them for deployment.
</Note>

After following the steps above, you should be redirected to the bot settings page. 

Follow the instructions below to deploy your bot and set your webhook url.

## Develop Your Bot

Now let's set up your bot development environment.

### Initialize Your Project

Create a new bot project using the Towns bot CLI:

```bash
bunx towns-bot init my-bot
```

This creates a new directory with a basic bot template.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd my-bot
bun install
```

### Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash .env
APP_PRIVATE_DATA=<your-app-private-data>
JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
PORT=3000
```

### Push to GitHub

Create a [new repository on GitHub](https://github.com/new), follow their instructions and push your bot code to it.


## Deploy Your Bot

We'll deploy to Render.com, which offers a generous free tier perfect for bot hosting.

1. **Sign up for Render**

   Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and create an account (can use GitHub login)

2. **Create New Web Service**

   - Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub account if prompted
   - Select your bot repository

3. **Configure the Service**

   Fill in the deployment settings:

   | Setting | Value |
   |---------|-------|
   | **Name** | `my-bot` (or any name you prefer) |
   | **Environment** | `Node` |
   | **Build Command** | `bun install && bun run build` |
   | **Start Command** | `bun run start` |

4. **Add Environment Variables**

   In the "Environment" section, add:

   | Key | Value |
   |-----|-------|
   | `APP_PRIVATE_DATA` | Your app private data from bot creation |
   | `JWT_SECRET` | Your JWT secret from bot creation |
   | `PORT` | `3000` |

5. **Deploy**

   Click "Create Web Service". Render will:
   - Clone your repository
   - Run `bun install`
   - Start your bot with `bun run src/index.ts`

   Wait for the deploy to finish. You'll get a URL like:
   ```
   https://my-bot.onrender.com
   ```

<Note>
Free tier services on Render may spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity. The first request after spin-down may take 30-60 seconds. Consider upgrading to a paid plan for production bots.
</Note>

## Configure in Towns

Now that your bot is deployed and publicly accessible, connect it to Towns.

### Set Webhook URL

1. Go back to [app.towns.com/developer](https://app.towns.com/developer)
2. Click on your bot
3. Under "Webhook URL", enter:
   ```
   https://my-bot.onrender.com/webhook
   ```
   <Warning>
   Don't forget the `/webhook` path at the end!
   </Warning>

4. Click "Save"

### Configure Forwarding Settings

In the bot settings page, under "Forwarding Settings", choose which messages your bot receives.

- **All Messages** - Bot receives every message in channels it's in
  - Use for: AI agents, moderation bots, analytics, logging
  - Warning: High volume in active channels

- **Mentions, Replies & Reactions** - Bot only receives:
  - Direct @mentions
  - Replies to bot's messages
  - Reactions to bot's messages
  - Slash commands
  - Use for: Most interactive bots

- **No Messages** - Bot receives no messages
  - Use for: Bots that only respond to external triggers (e.g. GitHub webhooks)

Click "Save" after selecting your preference.


### Install Bot to a Space

Finally, install your bot to a space to start using it:

1. In Towns app, go to a space you own or admin
2. Go to Space Settings â†’ Bots
3. Search for your bot by username
4. Click "Install"
5. Grant permissions as needed

Your bot is now live! ðŸŽ‰

## Testing Your Bot

Try these to verify everything works:

In the channel you installed your bot to, mention your bot:
```
@mybot hello
```

The bot should respond with "Hello! ðŸ‘‹"



## Next Steps

Now that your bot is running, explore more capabilities:

- [Learn about event handlers](/build/bots/events) - Handle different event types
- [Add slash commands](/build/bots/slash-commands) - Create custom `/help`, `/poll`, etc.
- [External interactions](/build/bots/external-interactions) - Timers, webhooks, custom APIs
