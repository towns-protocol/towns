title: Getting Started
---

This guide will walk you through creating, developing, and deploying your first Towns bot. You'll learn how to:

1. [Create a bot in Towns](#create-a-bot)
2. [Set up your development environment](#develop-your-bot)
3. [Deploy to Render.com](#deploy-your-bot)
4. [Configure your bot in Towns](#configure-in-towns)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- [Node.js v20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed (download for your OS)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) installed (download for your OS)
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) with SSH key configured (for pushing your bot code)
  - [Create SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
  - [Upload SSH key to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

## Create a Bot

1. **Visit the Developer Portal**

   Go to [app.towns.com/developer](https://app.towns.com/developer)

2. **Create New Bot**

   Fill in the details and click "Create Bot".

3. **Save Your Credentials**

   After creation, you'll receive two critical values:

   - `APP_PRIVATE_DATA` - Your bot's private key and encryption device (base64 encoded string)
   - `JWT_SECRET` - Used to verify webhook requests from Towns servers

<Note>
   Store these securely - you'll need them for deployment.
</Note>

After following the steps above, you should be redirected to the bot settings page. 

Follow the instructions below to deploy your bot and set your webhook url.

## Develop Your Bot

Now let's set up your bot development environment.

### Initialize Your Project

Create a new bot project using the Towns bot CLI:

```bash
bunx towns-bot init my-bot
```

This creates a new directory with a basic bot template.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd my-bot
bun install
```

### Configure Environment

Copy the `.env.sample` file in your project root:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

### Push to GitHub

Create a [new repository on GitHub](https://github.com/new), follow their instructions, commit all your changes and push your bot code to it.


## Deploy Your Bot

We'll deploy to Render.com, which offers a generous free tier perfect for bot hosting.

1. **Sign up for Render**

   Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and create an account (can use GitHub login)

2. **Create New Web Service**

   - Click "New +" → "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub account if prompted
   - Select your bot repository

3. **Configure the Service**

   Fill in the deployment settings:

   | Setting | Value |
   |---------|-------|
   | **Name** | `my-bot` (or any name you prefer) |
   | **Language** | `Node` |
   | **Build Command** | `bun install` |
   | **Start Command** | `bun run start` |

4. **Add Environment Variables**

   In the "Environment" section, you can either paste your `.env` file contents or add each variable manually.

   | Key | Value |
   |-----|-------|
   | `APP_PRIVATE_DATA` | Your app private data from bot creation |
   | `JWT_SECRET` | Your JWT secret from bot creation |
   | `PORT` | `5123` |

5. **Deploy**

   Click "Create Web Service". Render will:
   - Clone your repository
   - Run `bun install` to build your bot
   - Start your bot with `bun run start`

   Wait for the deploy to finish. You'll get a URL like:
   ```
   https://my-bot.onrender.com
   ```

<Note>
Free tier services on Render may spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity. The first request after spin-down may take 30-60 seconds. Consider upgrading to a paid plan for production bots.
</Note>

## Configure in Towns

Now that your bot is deployed and publicly accessible, connect it to Towns.

### Set Webhook URL

1. Go back to [app.towns.com/developer](https://app.towns.com/developer)
2. Click on your bot
3. Under "Webhook URL", enter:
   ```
   https://my-bot.onrender.com/webhook
   ```
   <Warning>
   Don't forget the `/webhook` path at the end!
   </Warning>

4. Click "Save"

### Configure Forwarding Settings

In the bot settings page, under "Forwarding Settings", choose which messages your bot receives.

- **All Messages** - Bot receives every event in channels it's in
  - All event handlers available. See [Events](/build/bots/events) for more information.
  - Use for: AI agents, moderation bots, analytics, or when you need tip/membership events

- **Mentions, Commands, Replies & Reactions** (Default) - Bot only receives:
  - Direct @mentions, replies to bot's messages, reactions, and slash commands
  - Available handlers: `onMessage` (filtered), `onSlashCommand`, `onReaction`, `onMessageEdit`, `onRedaction`
  - NOT available: `onTip`, `onChannelJoin`, `onChannelLeave`, `onEventRevoke`
  - Use for: Most interactive bots

- **No Messages** - Bot receives no message events
  - Use for: External-only bots (e.g., GitHub webhooks, scheduled tasks)

Click "Save" after selecting your preference.


### Install Bot to a Space

Finally, install your bot to a space to start using it:

1. In Towns app, go to a space you own or admin
2. Go to Space Settings → Bots
3. Search for your bot by username
4. Click "Install"
5. Grant permissions as needed

Your bot is now live! 🎉

## Understanding Your Bot's Wallet Architecture

Your bot has two wallets that work together:

### Bot Treasury Wallet

The **Bot Treasury Wallet** (`bot.appAddress`) is a SimpleAccount (ERC-4337) smart contract that holds your bot's funds:
- **Receives funds**: All tips and payments sent to your bot are stored here
- **Stores assets**: This is where ETH and tokens are held
- **Source for payments**: When your bot sends tips to users, funds come from this wallet

To fund your bot treasury, send Base ETH directly to `bot.appAddress` from any wallet.

### Gas Wallet

The **Gas Wallet** (`bot.viem.account`) pays for gas fees on bot transactions:
- **Signs transactions**: Authorizes all operations on behalf of the bot treasury
- **Pays gas fees**: Needs Base ETH to cover transaction costs
- **Fund this wallet**: Required for any blockchain transactions

<Warning>
Your gas wallet MUST be funded with Base ETH to execute any blockchain transactions (sending tips, banning users, etc.). Without gas, your bot cannot perform onchain operations.
</Warning>

### When to Fund Each

**Fund your Gas Wallet when:**
- Your bot needs to send tips to users
- Your bot performs moderation actions (ban/unban)
- Your bot interacts with smart contracts
- You see "insufficient funds for gas" errors

**Fund your Bot Treasury when:**
- Your bot needs to send tips from its treasury
- You want to receive payments and tips
- Your bot needs to hold ETH/tokens for operations

<Note>
The gas wallet credentials are provided in `APP_PRIVATE_DATA` during bot creation. You can extract the wallet address from this value to fund it.
</Note>

## Testing Your Bot

Try these to verify everything works:

In the channel you installed your bot to, mention your bot:
```
@mybot hello
```

The bot should respond with "Hello there! 👋"
