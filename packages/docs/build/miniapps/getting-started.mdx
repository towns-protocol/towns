To build a Mini App for Towns, follow the [Farcaster Getting Started guide](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/docs/getting-started).

## Sharing Mini Apps in Towns

Once you've built your Mini App, you can share it in Towns in two ways:

### 1. Via Bots

Bots can share Mini Apps as link attachments in messages:

```typescript
await bot.sendMessage(channelId, "Check out this Mini App!", {
  attachments: [{
    type: 'link',
    url: 'https://your-miniapp.com'
  }]
})
```

### 2. Via Direct URLs

Users can paste Mini App URLs directly in Towns conversations. The Towns client will automatically render compatible Mini Apps.

## Testing

Test your Mini App in the Towns alpha environment before deploying to production.
