Mini Apps enable developers to distribute apps to Towns users without requiring app store approval.

Towns follows the [Farcaster miniapp specification](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/), allowing developers to build interactive experiences using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What are Mini Apps?

Mini Apps are web applications that run within Towns, providing users with interactive experiences directly in their conversations. They can:

- Access user context and Towns-specific data
- Integrate with Ethereum wallets
- Compose messages back to Towns
- Provide rich, interactive experiences without leaving the app

## Getting Started

For a complete guide on building Mini Apps, refer to the [Farcaster Mini Apps documentation](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/).

Towns extends the Farcaster specification with additional context data. See the [Context](/build/miniapps/context) section for Towns-specific extensions.
